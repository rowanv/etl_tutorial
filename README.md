# etl_tutorial
A repository for my talk at #DevFest 2015. We build a simple ETL (extract, transform, load) application using Python's Flask framework and Pandas libraries. We will read in data from an API, transform the data, undertake some analysis, and finally present it in a web-based GUI. Join us and learn how to take the first steps towards data development!
