== What is ETL?

== Why do we need ETL systems?

== Data science!
* Data science vs. statistics

== Extract

== Transform

== Load

== Challenges
* Testing
* Data transformations among heterogeneous systems
* Big data! Hadoop?
* Useability vs. generalizability

== Let's build our app!
* Flask in 30 sec.
* Microframework. Jinja2.
* Flask is Fun! flask.pocoo.org
* route() decorators map URLs to functions

== Let's build our app!

[source,python]
----
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
----

[source, bash]
$python run.py
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

== Extract

== Transform
* Pandas in 30 sec

== Transform

== Load
* We can visualize, but we could just as easily be writing to a DB

== But I want to deploy this!
* Yay!
* Change out your development server for something production-ready.
* nginx
* gunicorn
